# PricingTable
Pricing Table with jQuery DataTable with DropDown Features for Dynamic values and Links

Here’s a quick breakdown of what the code does:

Styles and Scripts:

Includes styles and scripts for jQuery, DataTables, and FixedHeader to enable the table functionality with sorting, filtering, and fixed headers.
jQuery & JavaScript:

Sets up a DataTable for the pricing table with no pagination, no sorting, and a fixed header.
Dynamically changes the prices in the table based on the number of contacts selected from a dropdown.
Changes the sign-up links dynamically based on the contact number selected.
Table Structure:

Displays three pricing plans: Startup, Growth, and Scale with respective prices.
Shows different features (like Email Marketing, AI Assistant, etc.) with checkmarks or X’s to indicate availability.
The sign-up links change dynamically as per the number of contacts selected.
Styling:

CSS styles have been customized to match the look and feel of the pricing table, buttons, and other elements on the page.

Key Changes & Comments:
DataTables & jQuery initialization: Ensures that the table is fully interactive.
Dynamic price updating: When a different contact option is selected, the pricing is updated dynamically.
Dynamic sign-up links: The links for each plan are updated based on the contact value.
HTML structure: Organized to clearly distinguish between sections like plan details, pricing, and features.
This code should now be easy to follow, with comments explaining the purpose of each section. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
